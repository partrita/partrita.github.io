    "## 2. Antibiotics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kanamycin\n",
    "#### Mode of Action\n",
    "Bacteriocidal. Diffuses through the porinchannels in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. Interacts with at least three ribosomal proteins, inhibiting protein synthesis and increasing translation errors. \n",
    "#### Working Concentration and Stock Solution\n",
    "Working concentration is 50 μg/ml, or 25 μg/ml for low-copy plasmids. Stock solution is 35 mg/ml in water (kanamycin is insoluble in 50% alcohol). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Ampicillin\n",
    "#### Mode of Action\n",
    "\n",
    "Inhibits the formation of cross-links in the peptidoglycan layer (which provides rigidity to the cell wall). Most effective against cells in log phase growth (since this is when new cross-links are being formed), and has little effect on cells in stationary phase. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stock Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical concentrations of ampicillin are 50 μg/mL for low copy plasmids and 100 μg/mL for high copy plasmids. Stock solutions are typically at 100 mg/ml, so that 1 ml of antibiotic can be added to 1 liter of broth or agar. Stock solutions made in 50% alcohol remain liquid at -20°C and are easy to pipet. Cool agar to 55°C or below prior to adding antibiotic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ampicillin available from Sigma A-9518 (Ampicillin sodium salt), FW 371.39. To make 100ml of 100 mg/ml stock solution, dissolve 10 g of ampicillin in 50 ml of water and 50 ml of 100% ethanol.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stability\n",
    "\n",
    "Culture plates with ampicillin can be stored at 2-8°C for up to two weeks. (In our experience, plates are usable for 2-3 months when stored at 4°C and bagged to prevent evaporation.)  \n",
    "Stock solutions may be stored at 2-8°C for up to 3 weeks. For long term storage (4-6 months), stock solutions should be stored at -20°C. At 37°C in culture, ampicillin is stable up to 3 days. [Sigma reference](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/sigma/product%20information%20sheet/a0166pis.pdf) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Carbenicillin\n",
    "\n",
    "Carbenicillin is used to select for cells bearing the beta-lactamase gene bla or ampR. Beta-lactamase also neutralizes ampicillin, but due to ampicillin's lower effectiveness, carbenicillin tends to give fewer satellite colonies and makes for more reliable cloning. Ampicillin is more widely used, though, due to carbenicillin's high cost ($75/g compared to ampicillin's $10/g (Sigma)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tetracycline\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mode of Action\n",
    "\n",
    "Tetracyclines (there are many) enter the cell by diffusion through OmpF porins. It inhibits growth by preventing codon-anticodon interactions during translation. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Working concentration and Stock Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a plasmid with copy number 15-20, 20μg/ml tet has proved a successful selector. The reduction in growth rate, described above was significant.\n",
    "The RajBhandary lab uses 5μg/ml and see a minimal reduction in growth rate and never lose plasmid from their cells.\n",
    "Stock solution is 15 mg/ml in 50% ethanol (note: using 95-100% ethanol is much better for dissolving stock powder). Add 1 ml per liter of cooled broth or agar. Solutions and plates are light sensitive.\n",
    "Tetracycline is incompatible with (chelated by) magnesium ions, and thus unsuitable for use in minimal media\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Streptomycin\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mode of Action\n",
    "\n",
    "Inhibits protein synthesis; binds to 30S ribosomal subunit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rpsL50 gene mutation conveys streptomycin resistance. Resistance is recessive, so the presence of a wild type rpsL gene will convey sensitivity. This allows counter-selection against the presence of the wt rpsL gene. Mutations of wild type genes to convey resistance are common. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Working concentration and Stock Solutions\n",
    "100 mg/mL stock solution in water. It is barely soluble in ethanol so you must dissolve it in water. Add 1 mL per liter of culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chloramphenicol\n",
    "#### Mode of Action\n",
    "\n",
    "Chloramphenicol is a bacteriostatic agent that binds to the 50S ribosomal subunit and inhibits ribosomal peptide bond formation. It is sometimes used as a way of \"amplifying\" plasmid production by shutting down protein synthesis in cultures, while allowing plasmid replication to continue. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Working Concentrations and Stock Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "High copy plasmids allow 35 μg/ml concentration. Low-copy plasmids like bacterial artificial chromosomes allow 12.5 μg/ml. Stock solutions can be made at 35 mg/ml in ethanol, kept at -20C. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Neomycin\n",
    "#### Mode of action\n",
    "binds to ribosomal components and inhibits protein synthesis. target organism: bacteria, mammalian cells\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Working Concentrations and Stock Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "stock solution: 10mg/ml in water\n",
    "working solution: 10-50µg/ml (stable at RT for 5days)\n",
