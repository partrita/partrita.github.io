    "## 2. Antibiotics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kanamycin\n",
    "#### Mode of Action\n",
    "Bacteriocidal. Diffuses through the porinchannels in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. Interacts with at least three ribosomal proteins, inhibiting protein synthesis and increasing translation errors. \n",
    "#### Working Concentration and Stock Solution\n",
    "Working concentration is 50 μg/ml, or 25 μg/ml for low-copy plasmids. Stock solution is 35 mg/ml in water (kanamycin is insoluble in 50% alcohol). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Ampicillin\n",
    "#### Mode of Action\n",
    "\n",
    "Inhibits the formation of cross-links in the peptidoglycan layer (which provides rigidity to the cell wall). Most effective against cells in log phase growth (since this is when new cross-links are being formed), and has little effect on cells in stationary phase. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stock Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical concentrations of ampicillin are 50 μg/mL for low copy plasmids and 100 μg/mL for high copy plasmids. Stock solutions are typically at 100 mg/ml, so that 1 ml of antibiotic can be added to 1 liter of broth or agar. Stock solutions made in 50% alcohol remain liquid at -20°C and are easy to pipet. Cool agar to 55°C or below prior to adding antibiotic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ampicillin available from Sigma A-9518 (Ampicillin sodium salt), FW 371.39. To make 100ml of 100 mg/ml stock solution, dissolve 10 g of ampicillin in 50 ml of water and 50 ml of 100% ethanol.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stability\n",
    "\n",
    "Culture plates with ampicillin can be stored at 2-8°C for up to two weeks. (In our experience, plates are usable for 2-3 months when stored at 4°C and bagged to prevent evaporation.)  \n",
    "Stock solutions may be stored at 2-8°C for up to 3 weeks. For long term storage (4-6 months), stock solutions should be stored at -20°C. At 37°C in culture, ampicillin is stable up to 3 days. [Sigma reference](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/sigma/product%20information%20sheet/a0166pis.pdf) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Carbenicillin\n",
    "\n",
    "Carbenicillin is used to select for cells bearing the beta-lactamase gene bla or ampR. Beta-lactamase also neutralizes ampicillin, but due to ampicillin's lower effectiveness, carbenicillin tends to give fewer satellite colonies and makes for more reliable cloning. Ampicillin is more widely used, though, due to carbenicillin's high cost ($75/g compared to ampicillin's $10/g (Sigma)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tetracycline\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mode of Action\n",
    "\n",
    "Tetracyclines (there are many) enter the cell by diffusion through OmpF porins. It inhibits growth by preventing codon-anticodon interactions during translation. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Working concentration and Stock Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a plasmid with copy number 15-20, 20μg/ml tet has proved a successful selector. The reduction in growth rate, described above was significant.\n",
    "The RajBhandary lab uses 5μg/ml and see a minimal reduction in growth rate and never lose plasmid from their cells.\n",
    "Stock solution is 15 mg/ml in 50% ethanol (note: using 95-100% ethanol is much better for dissolving stock powder). Add 1 ml per liter of cooled broth or agar. Solutions and plates are light sensitive.\n",
    "Tetracycline is incompatible with (chelated by) magnesium ions, and thus unsuitable for use in minimal media\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Streptomycin\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mode of Action\n",
    "\n",
    "Inhibits protein synthesis; binds to 30S ribosomal subunit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rpsL50 gene mutation conveys streptomycin resistance. Resistance is recessive, so the presence of a wild type rpsL gene will convey sensitivity. This allows counter-selection against the presence of the wt rpsL gene. Mutations of wild type genes to convey resistance are common. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Working concentration and Stock Solutions\n",
    "100 mg/mL stock solution in water. It is barely soluble in ethanol so you must dissolve it in water. Add 1 mL per liter of culture.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chloramphenicol\n",
    "#### Mode of Action\n",
    "\n",
    "Chloramphenicol is a bacteriostatic agent that binds to the 50S ribosomal subunit and inhibits ribosomal peptide bond formation. It is sometimes used as a way of \"amplifying\" plasmid production by shutting down protein synthesis in cultures, while allowing plasmid replication to continue. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Working Concentrations and Stock Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "High copy plasmids allow 35 μg/ml concentration. Low-copy plasmids like bacterial artificial chromosomes allow 12.5 μg/ml. Stock solutions can be made at 35 mg/ml in ethanol, kept at -20C. \n",

    "#### Antarctic Phosphatase\n",
    "    \n",
    "This enzyme is preferable to either Calf Intestinal Phosphatase or Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase because it is more easily heat-inactivated. After phosphatase treatment of a vector, any remaining enzymatic activity would remove 5' phosphates from the insert in a subsequent ligation reaction, preventing a successful reaction. Thus, it is critical that the phosphatase be inactivated, purified away, or digested with Proteinase K. \n",

    "\n",
    "Pfu has proof reading activity which makes it more accurate than for example Taq.\n",
    "Pfu does not exhibit 5' -> 3' exonuclease activity, which prevents degradation of the primers in mutagenesis methods based on ligation of primers or elongated primers.\n",
    "Pfu is slower than Taq and one should calculate 2 min per 1000 bp (1 min for Taq)\n",

    "- TBE offers a higher resolution and has a higher buffering capacity at greater temperatures induced by relatively higher voltages\n",
    "- TBE can negatively influence the yield of DNA after recovery from a gel when using glass-based protocols. Yield does not seem to be influenced when using silica-based methods.\n",
    "- The bromide ion in TBE is a powerful inhibitor of enzyme activity. This can prevent degradation of nucleic acid, but can also interfere with subsequent experiments like cloning DNA into a vector. \n",

    "### Phenol\n",
    "Phenol is an important chemical in biological research. It is used primarily for isolation and purification of DNA and RNA. Pure phenol is solid at room temperature. Almost all biochemical uses of phenol use a water saturated phenol solution, or a mixture of phenol in chloroform.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Safety\n",
    "\n",
    "Phenol is caustic and causes nasty chemical burns which are slow to heal. It is also a systemic poison which can be rapidly absorbed through the skin. \n",

    "### PMSF\n",
    "\n",
    "PMSF stands for Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. It is used as an irreversible inhibitor of serine protease activity for example in protein purification or co-immunoprecipitation. It has no effect on other proteases that might be present. It can also inactivate some non-proteolytic enzymes that contain serine in the active site.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use\n",
    "\n",
    "PMSF is not soluble in water, dissolve in isopropanol, ethanol or methanol. 200 mM stock solution (0.035 g/mL) is stable for months at 4°C, although storage at -20 is probably better. A common final concentration of PMSF is 1mM. PMSF is extremely toxic, and preparation of solutions should be done very carefully. PMSF is not stable in alkaline conditions, or in water. For disposal, add alkali in water and wait to dispose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Safety\n",
    "\n",
    "PMSF is extremely poisonous and should be handled carefully. \n",

    "![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/oww-files-thumb/6/6d/Glycerol_chemical_formula.svg/300px-Glycerol_chemical_formula.svg.png)\n",
    "Glycerol is an alcohol often used in the lab to avoid freezing and increase the density of liquids. Its standardised IUPAC name is propane-1,2,3-triol. It is also often referred to as glycerine or glycerin. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Density\n",
    "\n",
    "Glycerol is used in many loading buffers to increase the density of the solution which enables good loading into already liquid filled wells of agarose and polyacrylamide gels. See agarose gel loading buffer and SDS sample buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Freezing\n",
    "\n",
    "Glycerol is also used to decrease the freezing point of protein solution which are easily degraded by repeated freeze/thaw cycles. A 50% (w/v) glycerol/water solution freezes at -25ºC and can thus be stored in a -20ºC freezer. Note that glycerol with 1.26g/cm3 is much denser than water and, therefore, a 50% (v/v) solution will be very different from a 50% (w/v) solution. For example, restriction enzymes are typically stored in a glycerol/water solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Ficoll\n",
    "\n",
    "Ficoll™ is a sucrose polymer commonly used to adjust the density and viscosity of solutions in the lab. It is employed in density gradients and loading buffers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common applications for Ficoll is as a density gradient for the isolation of eukaryotic cells, organelles, bacterial cells, and pancreatic islets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Ficoll is an uncharged, highly branched polymer formed by the co-polymerisation of sucrose and epichlorohydrin. Due to its many hydroxyl groups, Ficoll is highly soluble in water. Densities of up to 1.2 g/ml can be attained.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stability & storage\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Ficoll does not contain any ionized groups, the molecule does not readily react under physiological conditions. It is stable in alkaline and neutral solutions, but is rapidly hydrolysed in solution at pH 3, especially at high temperature. However, Ficoll can be autoclaving at 110ºC for 30 minutes in neutral solutions. Strong oxidizing and reducing agents should be avoided. Shipping and storage are at ambient temperatures. \n",
    "\n",
    "### DNA dyes\n",
    "\n",
    "DNA dyes stain deoxyribonucleic acid for laboratory purposes such as detection and quantification. Many DNA dyes also bind to RNA and could be more broadly described as nucleic acid stains. Common dyes included ethidium bromide (EtBr), esp. for agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA, and DAPI for staining the cell nucleus in fluorescent microscopy. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dyes for DNA in agarose gel electrophoresis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ethidium bromide : traditional DNA stain.\n",
    "- SYBR Gold : 10x more sensitive than EtBr\n",
